#nand2tetris project 2 and 6
Individual assignment 4 for advanced programming: Project 2 and 6 from the nand2tetris online course.

###Project 2:
Build the following chips: Half- and FullAdder, 16-bit Adder and Incrementer, ALU (with and without output status handler)
In order to build the Half- and FullAdder chips we needed some basic logic chips (Not, And, Or, Xor) from project 1.

In order to make sure the chips are working correctly individually, we test the .hdl chips with .tst files which compares the outputs (.out) to the .cmp file.
